# Purpose
The purpose of this Usability test (UT) was to gather a baseline for how good or bad the website andyguitar.co.uk is for a middle aged man wanting to learn to play the guitar. The first assignment for this course was to carry out a heuristic evaluation for this website. Based on the findings from the evaluation I wanted to test how easy it would be for users to navigate through simple tasks. The task I created for this usability test takes into consideration the type of task a new guitar player will encounter like navigating to the first lesson of the beginners course, searching for a song tutorial, or learning how to play the guitar without a pick.

# Findings 
During this UT test I learned what went well, what did not go well and it taught me how to approach my next UT. I think this test went well for the most part, some things that went well was the participant i had was very thoughtful and accommodating towards the survey and what was asked. This made the experience as a moderator effortless. I think that the interviewee provided valuable feedback for the website and for myself so that I can improve this UT. I think some things that didn't go so well was the task performance section of the survey. It wasn't as intuitive as I thought it would be for users. I need to create more steps so that I can properly guide each user through the task rather than assuming they would understand what to do after doing the task the first time. Additionally, I was caught off guard by the amount of questions the interviewee had so I'm glad that I had spent time on the website prior to the UT. For the future I want to make sure that I provide more steps for the task/scenario section of the UT.
