## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AlejoFernandez126/Github-website-Markwodn-DH110/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Welcome, here you will find a little bit about me, but not enought to know me.

' import pandas as pd'
 
 As somone who does not have much coding experience, importing and using the pandas library was something I used a lot last quarter.
 
 I am a fourth year student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I'm curious yet loose interest fast.
 
 _I look foward to learning more from this class_
