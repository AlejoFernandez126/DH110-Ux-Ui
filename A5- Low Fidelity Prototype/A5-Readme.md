#### Alejo Fernandez | A5- Low fidelity wire frame prototype | DH 110 UX/UI | Spring 2022, UCLA

# Overview

## About this project
  - #### The main objective for this website is to offer a free online course that allows users to learn how to play the guitar. GuitarmadeEZ is a website that is specifically designed for people that want to learn how to play the guitar with no prior experience. This low fidelity prototype is focusing on certain features so that the user has the best experience.

  - I created two different personas to get a better understanding of the user we are targeting for this project. The first user is Ben, he is a middle aged caucasian male, living in Los Angeles California with their two children. Ben has little previous experience with learning to play the guitar, he had tried learning but never stuck with his lessons. Benâ€™s goal was to be able to finally learn how to play the guitar so that he can play a song for her birthday and also bond with his children since they don't know how to play an instrument either. The second persona I created was that of Daniel Hernandes, he is a 40 year old latin male living in Miami florida with his two children and wife. He also  works in the food industry and wants to learn how to play the guitar. He has a bust schedule, having to be the primary owner puts stress on Daniel which is why he doesn't have enough time to pursue his interest.Daniel is going to use GuitarmadeEZ so that he can cerenade his family when they are gathered, he has always wanted to do this so that his family cna bond over music.

## Purpose of Low-Fidelity Prototyping

  - #### Low-fidelity prototyping is a low-cost method of designing and testing the usability of the features in a product (as well as how they are organized). The prototype outlines the flow of the features and how the user might navigate through them, without placing too much emphasis on appearances. Through low-fidelity prototyping, the designer can gauge the ease of use for the features of the product.

## Tasks
  - This low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks, based on the presumed basic needs of the target audience:
  - Onboarding (creating account)
  - Search for song tutorial
  - Selecting a specific lesson
