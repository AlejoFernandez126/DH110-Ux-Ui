# Description

- The purpose of this assignment was to go from a low fidelity prototype to a working design within a single screen. I decided to focus on the landing page of my guitar learning website. For my guitar learning website, I want it to be a place where users can navigate the site either through their desktop/laptop, i will be working on the mobile device version as well. For this assignment I wanted to focus on the desktop version of the site. I began by creating a grid so that I can measure things proportionally. I spent a good amount of time working with the tools in order to understand how to properly manipulate the elements to produce the vision I have. I kept trying different elements, and variations to see what was most appealing to my eye. I created a wire frame and then I used it as my foundation for the website design. Please refer to the link below to see my entire design.

## Typography varitation

  - I created 3 different version of my design using 3 different type of fonts. The first font is called ‘inter’ the second font is referred to as ‘kdam’, the third font is the font i went with for my final design which is ‘baloo’

## Shape variation 

  - For the shape variation of this assignment I created 3 different types of shapes variations. The first is circular, meaning I rounded the edges on buttons and images. The second is making the switch to a saure form rather than rounded. Lastly, for the last variation I combined the square and rounded elements in one variation.

## Color variation
 - For the color variations I created two types. I created a light mode and a dark mode. Below you will also see images of of the color contrast check.
