# The purpose of UX Storytelling
  - The creation of personas with a well designed user experience story creates an environment in which we can immerse ourselves completely to meet the needs of the user. By looking at their motivations, needs, goals and challenges we are able to make specific research questions that enable creators to create the best experience for the user. This approach lets us begin the service ideation process in a way that disrupts conventional thinking. With this type of methodology we are able to create a product based on user wants and needs instead of maximizing profits. Not that the end goal is to be profitable but rather the fuel used to drive our creativity is based on a user wanting to use our service over any other.
