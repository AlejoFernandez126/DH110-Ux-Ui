# The purpose of UX Storytelling
  - The creation of personas with a well designed user experience story creates an environment in which we can immerse ourselves completely to meet the needs of the user. By looking at their motivations, needs, goals and challenges we are able to make specific research questions that enable creators to create the best experience for the user. This approach lets us begin the service ideation process in a way that disrupts conventional thinking. With this type of methodology we are able to create a product based on user wants and needs instead of maximizing profits. Not that the end goal is to be profitable but rather the fuel used to drive our creativity is based on a user wanting to use our service over any other.

### Reflection


The process of creating personas accompanied with their corresponding empathy map, scenarios, and your map was a fun and creative project. I think this was a great project to get my creative flow going since it stimulated me, i had to think clearly about the type of research questions I wanted to ask and how I was going to find that information. Using polls,census data, and other publicly available information I was able to let my inspiration take the reins of this project. As a result I came up with two individual user personas across the United States that suited the assignment. I feel given more time to build the personas I could have done better with Ben by planning my research questions better, rather than choosing them as I go. Daniel's persona was more thought out because I was able to use Benâ€™s as a warm up.
