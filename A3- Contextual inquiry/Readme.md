# A-3 Contextual inquiry
#### This is a qualitative user research assignment. Alejo Fernandez, Digital Humanities 110 UX/UI (user experience and design) Spring 22 UCLA
#### This projects main design challenge is about how to make learning to play the guitar as intuitive as possible for beginners.

- In order to gain insight into this matter, I decided to ask a couple of questions.

- What is the main activity your project would support for users?
    - This project will help users learn how to play the guitar by creating a simple and interactive learning experience targeted towards beginners.

- What is the basic need/goal involved in this activity?
     - This activity will enable the user to learn how to play the guitar, it will help the users emotional well being as well as keeping their mind stimulated. By learning how to play the guitar users will be able to gain rhythmic and creative skills that will help them express themselves. Creating a simple platform to learn how to play the guitar will enable the guitar player that gets afraid of how difficult it seems.

- What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

    - Traditional solutions to satisfy the needs involve in person classes, in either a group or one-on-one format. Some communities and religious organizations offer classes as well. There are also plenty of YouTube Tutorials, apps, and websites that offer courses for beginners.

- How can digital technology improve upon the current limitations users experience?
    - Digital technology can help users that live in remote areas or where there is a lack of guitar instructors. In this sense the geographical location of some users may be a limiting factor, offering a virtual experienced could mitigate that for new guitar players. New guitar players can also feel shy about their lack of experience or how long it may take them to learn something, therefore practicing from home by themselves will enable private learning experience. Furthermore, time can be a limiting factor. Some people have full time jobs and a family to raise, others have their academics, social and familial obligations, so having the ability to learn at your own pace is a way that technology can disrupt current learning limitations.

## Target Users

The following characteristics are the type that I would expect from the target user.


- __Demographics__ : 
    - Working and retired men age 35 and up. Have a busy schedule between work and familial responsibilities.


- __Preferences__: 
    - The user should have a desire to learn how to play the guitar, or at least be inspired to play by hearing the guitar through their favorite songs. Someone who would like to learn how to play to be able to merge their love for music with their friends, family, and community by playing the guitar with or for them.


- __Expertise__: 
    - There is no minimum level of experience required to learn for this project. Users that have little to no experience are welcomed. Users that want to understand or brush up on fundamentals that were self-taught.
In a traditional setting users would learn how to play the guitar by having an instructor with them or by watching a video online in order to learn how to play the guitar.
For someone that wants to learn how to play the guitar, that person would typically search online or ask friends or family members if they know any guitar instructors. If the user decided to take clases with an instuctror, the classes can be held at a physical location which requires the user and instructor to coordinate schedule for their lesson. If the user prefers to learn how to play online then there are remote options that users can pick from. The user can then access these tutorials at their convenience.

## Research Methods

- I decided to utilize a combination of methods, I used an __interview and participatory observation__ methods. Both of these methods were conducted virtually through Zomm with the participant logging in from their convenience. Learning to play an instrument seems to be just as intimate as it an interview.

- During the interview portion, I asked the participant various questions regarding their background and experience with guitar playing. I asked how often she plays the guitar, what inspires her to play, what are some ways that she practices and what her goals are.I had a script prepared but i knew that if she mentioned something interesting I would let her take the conversation to have a conversation-esque type of interview.

- For the participatory observation of this interview I asked the participant to share with me their guitar playing journey since she has been playing on and off for about a year now. I asked her what inspired her to learn how to play and to demonstrate the type of way that she has learned to play the guitar. I also asked what her ideal tool/innovation would be to help beginners.

### Observation 

- Time 5:59
    - User commentary “I, like I said, I like that. There's the ability for somebody to correct you right away when you make a mistake versus like when I'm at home. And I just got my phone in front of me, like for my chords on my phone, I just, if I make a mistake, I could just hear it.”
        -  Observations: There are pros and cons to in person lessons and online lessons. In person lessons have the upper hand in being able to physically guide the user on how to fix something. Online lessons have the convenience of learning at your own pace.


- Time 11:05
    -  User commentary “I just think that it's like been really good for my mental health. Just playing with. Especially throughout the pandemic. Um, and just continuing to learn is like, that's just helping me, like with my happiness” 
        -  Observations: playing the guitar is a healthy way to stimulate your mental health as well as your emotional well being. Learning to play the guitar is a creative and emotional outlet for people. This is another reason why more people should feel encourage to learn this instrument.


- Time 15:08 
    - User commentary “for me, I think it's just exciting to try to learn something that I know. And I really like, and then that'll just like, you'll play for hours and hours.” 
        - Observation: once the user find a song that they are interested in learning, they will spend a good amount of their time practicing that song. That means that the retention rate for a user is high once they find a song that they want to genuinely learn to play and that fits they level of playing. Ideally a web/app should constantly update their song tutorial library and have it organized by difficulty 


- Time 20:58
   - User commentary “ can you tell me about an experience that took you a long time when you were learning to play the guitar? Um, I would say two things, major things would be, um, one being switching between chords fast.”
        - Observation: Switching between chords fast is essential to the rhythm of the song therefore this skill is essential to be able to play any song. A forum of FAQ or tips for this specific issue would encourage users to keep practicing as other users would share their tips and experiences learning this skill.


- Time 21:42
    - User commentary “my strumming, which we've gotten a lot better at, it was hard at first.
        - Observation: Learning to switch chords is one skill and strumming is another skill. This further demonstrates the types of skills that users are required to master if they want to play their favorite songs on the guitar. Strumming tips and member testimonials should also be included within the same forum as the chord switching skill.

#### A short reflection on what you learned from the field study and what you would want to do differently in the future.

-   My reflection from this field study is that there are overlapping themes that each beginner guitar player encounters that instructors overlook since it has been a long time since they struggled with that issue. In other words, because instructors have years of experience it may be hard to relate or view the struggles from the students perspective when struggling to learn a chord or strumming skill. Additionally, I noticed it was difficult for her to remember the name of the website where she was learning her chords or would search for guitar tutorials. This implies that either all the websites have a similar look or  lack the same things making it easy to blur one website with another. Lastly, I thought it was amazing to hear that learning to play the guitar is a way for her to feel connected to her family as well as how much of a positive impact it has had on her well being.

- If I further reflect on my experience, one of the ways that I would change what I did is that I would make sure to follow up with her more on certain questions. It seemed like she was still learning so i did not want to pressure her in any way but I feel that by having that approach I didn't get to ask her more in depth questions. I thought it was awesome how when she started playing and demonstrating a chord she felt genuinely enthused. That created a lasting impression since she had mentioned how much playing the guitar had helped her wellbeing.
