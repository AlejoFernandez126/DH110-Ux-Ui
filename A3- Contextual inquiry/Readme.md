# A-3 Contextual inquiry
#### This is a qualitative user research assignment. Alejo Fernandez, Digital Humanities 110 UX/UI (user experience and design) Spring 22 UCLA
#### This projects main design challenge is about how to make learning to play the guitar as intuitive as possible for beginners.

- In order to gain insight into this matter, I decided to ask a couple of questions.

- What is the main activity your project would support for users?
    - This project will help users learn how to play the guitar by creating a simple and interactive learning experience targeted towards beginners.

- What is the basic need/goal involved in this activity?
     - This activity will enable the user to learn how to play the guitar, it will help the users emotional well being as well as keeping their mind stimulated. By learning how to play the guitar users will be able to gain rhythmic and creative skills that will help them express themselves. Creating a simple platform to learn how to play the guitar will enable the guitar player that gets afraid of how difficult it seems.

- What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

    - Traditional solutions to satisfy the needs involve in person classes, in either a group or one-on-one format. Some communities and religious organizations offer classes as well. There are also plenty of YouTube Tutorials, apps, and websites that offer courses for beginners.

- How can digital technology improve upon the current limitations users experience?
    - Digital technology can help users that live in remote areas or where there is a lack of guitar instructors. In this sense the geographical location of some users may be a limiting factor, offering a virtual experienced could mitigate that for new guitar players. New guitar players can also feel shy about their lack of experience or how long it may take them to learn something, therefore practicing from home by themselves will enable private learning experience. Furthermore, time can be a limiting factor. Some people have full time jobs and a family to raise, others have their academics, social and familial obligations, so having the ability to learn at your own pace is a way that technology can disrupt current learning limitations.

## Target Users

The following characteristics are the type that I would expect from the target user.


- __Demographics__ : 
    - Working and retired men age 35 and up. Have a busy schedule between work and familial responsibilities.


- __Preferences__: 
    - The user should have a desire to learn how to play the guitar, or at least be inspired to play by hearing the guitar through their favorite songs. Someone who would like to learn how to play to be able to merge their love for music with their friends, family, and community by playing the guitar with or for them.


- __Expertise__: 
    - There is no minimum level of experience required to learn for this project. Users that have little to no experience are welcomed. Users that want to understand or brush up on fundamentals that were self-taught.
In a traditional setting users would learn how to play the guitar by having an instructor with them or by watching a video online in order to learn how to play the guitar.
For someone that wants to learn how to play the guitar, that person would typically search online or ask friends or family members if they know any guitar instructors. If the user decided to take clases with an instuctror, the classes can be held at a physical location which requires the user and instructor to coordinate schedule for their lesson. If the user prefers to learn how to play online then there are remote options that users can pick from. The user can then access these tutorials at their convenience.

## Research Methods

- I decided to utilize a combination of methods, I used an __interview and participatory observation__ methods. Both of these methods were conducted virtually through Zomm with the participant logging in from their convenience. Learning to play an instrument seems to be just as intimate as it an interview.

- During the interview portion, I asked the participant various questions regarding their background and experience with guitar playing. I asked how often she plays the guitar, what inspires her to play, what are some ways that she practices and what her goals are.I had a script prepared but i knew that if she mentioned something interesting I would let her take the conversation to have a conversation-esque type of interview.

- For the participatory observation of this interview I asked the participant to share with me their guitar playing journey since she has been playing on and off for about a year now. I asked her what inspired her to learn how to play and to demonstrate the type of way that she has learned to play the guitar. I also asked what her ideal tool/innovation would be to help beginners.
