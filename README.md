# DH110 UX/UI UCLA spring 22

# Hello World
This repo will consists of work for my Digital Humanities (DH110) course.

# About me
I am a fourth year student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am majoring in Philosophy and pursuing a minor in Digital Humanities.

# Topics for this course
This course focuses on user experience and design so the subject for this quarter has to do with finding a music learning, website or app that I can input my designs/thoughts to enhance the overall design or experience for the user. 
The name of the website i am hypothetically creating is "GuitarmadeEZ"

The two sites i am considering are: 

https://www.andyguitar.co.uk

and 

https://guitarzero2hero.com
