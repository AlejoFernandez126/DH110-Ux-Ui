# Hello,
Here you will find information about me and the course.

As someone that does not have much experience with coding there are a couple of things I did learn and retained from my previous course.

For example i learned,
``` import pandas as pd ``` 
Using the pandas library was something i got used to last quarter. I look foward to using it and learning more of its features.

# About me
I am a fourth year student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am majoring in Philosophy and pursuing a minor in Digital Humanities.
